## How It Works

### Step 1: Choose Your Interview Parameters

First, users can customize their interview experience by selecting the type of round (such as Technical, HR, or Behavioral), the role they are applying for, the technology stack they want to be tested on, and their level of experience.

### Step 2: Conduct Your Mock Interview

Once the parameters are set, users can start the interview. The AI generates questions based on the selected criteria, and users respond verbally. The AI listens and interacts in real-time, simulating a live interview scenario.

### Step 3: Receive Detailed Feedback

After completing the interview, users receive a comprehensive feedback report. This includes their overall score, a review of their answers, correct responses for comparison, and personalized feedback highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.
